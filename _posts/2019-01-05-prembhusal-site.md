Netflix ended 2018 with a bang, or shall we say tweet, tweet. 
Its original movie “Bird Box,” starring Sandra Bullock, hit the streaming service on Dec. 
21 and soon burst into a bajillion feathers, floating its way into the interwebs’ zeitgeist. 
As Chrissy Teigen told Kim Kardashian, “like everyone in the entire world” has seen it.

Directed by Susanne Bier and based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Josh Malerman, 
the film follows Malorie (Bullock), a mother who, along with two young children (appropriately named Boy and Girl), 
is making her way down a river, blindfolded, in an attempt to avoid supernatural entities that bring death to those 
who see them. The movie flips awkwardly back and forth between its past and present, explaining how Malorie first learned 
of the onslaught of underwhelming apocalyptic monsters alongside her sister (Sarah Paulson) and a band of survivors 
portrayed by Trevante Rhodes, John Malkovich, BD Wong and others.
